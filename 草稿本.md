 However, this may not be the lowest boundary for the implementation of CAVs as the 5G's low latency feature. Current study on CAVs also prove that the high quality of the wireless network will also benefit a lot to decentralised platoon control. \
 In particular situation (5G available), cars with different sensors and cameras or even non-automated vehicles could also get involved in the trajectory planning and global controlling.
